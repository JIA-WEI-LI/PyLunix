## Project Overview

**PyLunix** is a custom user interface (UI) widget library developed using **PyQt5**. The project aims to emulate and implement the design language and interface style of Microsoft **WinUI 3**, offering a set of modern, aesthetic, and visually consistent UI components—such as PushButtons—for Python desktop applications.

PyLunix is designed to provide developers with a lightweight and easily integrated solution to enhance the user experience and visual quality of their PyQt5 applications.

## Key Features

* **WinUI 3 Design Adoption:** The core design strictly adheres to the visual specifications of WinUI 3 (Windows App SDK), providing a familiar, modern interface aesthetic.
* **PyQt5 Implementation:** Built upon the powerful, cross-platform capabilities of PyQt5, ensuring stable operation of widgets across various operating systems.
* **Custom and Extensible:** All components are custom-implemented, allowing developers deep customization and extension to meet specific application requirements.
* **Gradual Updates and Optimization:** The project is currently in a phase of slow, continuous updates. We will progressively add new UI components and optimize the performance and visual fidelity of existing ones.
